Place holder description...

## Setup
1. Download/clone this repository;
2. Place any folders/files with .wav files (dev_flight, dev_static, flight_task, static_task, individual_motors_recordings) in the data folder.

__Note__: The data files can be found in a google drive (https://goo.gl/TvJfKu).

__Note__: (Optional) In the google drive there are also spectrogram figures of the individual motors that I created and zipped because they were too large. You can place them in stft/spectrograms/.

## File Organisation
