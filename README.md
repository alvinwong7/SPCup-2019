# DSP CUP
Place holder description...

TEMPORARY: For those unfamiliar with git check out this guide for command lines http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/. I'll chuck the useful ones in here if needed/when I'm bothered.

Create your own branch to work on, and only merge master to your branch when all the code is working. Try not to work on master.

## Setup
1. Download/clone this repository;
2. Place any folders/files with .wav files (dev_flight, dev_static, flight_task, static_task, individual_motors_recordings) in the data folder.

__Note__: The data files can be found in a google drive (https://goo.gl/TvJfKu).

__Note__: (Optional) In the google drive there are also spectrogram figures of the individual motors that I created and zipped because they were too large. You can place them in stft/spectrograms/.

## File Organisation
